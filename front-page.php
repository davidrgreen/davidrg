			<h2>Design is in the Details &mdash; So is Development</h2>
		</div>
		<p>
			I work with designers in order to bring their vision to life on the web. If a designer takes the time to fine tune the details then a developer should carry those details over to the actual website.
		</p>
		<p>
			That doesn't mean I'm a silent partner. Clients deserve the combined experience of the developer and designer being leveraged in order to meet the client's goals. If I'm given a design that will compromise user experience then I work with the designer to craft a solution that will preserve the feel of the design without frustrating users.

			<h2>And I Talk to More Than Computers!</h2>
		</div>
		<p>
			I'm no social butterfly, but I don't mind talking on the phone, Skype, in-person, by carrier pigeon, or CIA-trained spy squirrel.

		<p>
			As a youth pastor I wrote and delivered over 200 sermons, bringing my fear of speaking in front of crowds to a dull whimper. Off stage, while running my computer repair company I taught elderly and disabled clients how to use the internet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here's a couple videos of me teaching, and you can <a href="/blog">visit my blog</a> to see more examples of my writing.
